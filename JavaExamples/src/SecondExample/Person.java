//Here is an example of a simple class called 'Person'.  It has two attributes and four methods. 
//Note that the attributes are declared private so that they can only be accessed by the methods,
//not by anything outside the class.

// We are also showing the concept of chaining constructors. 

class Person {
	private String name;
	private int age;

	public Person() {
		System.out.println("Default constructor in chain");
	}

	// This is the second constructor called in the chain. Note that it calls
	// the default constructor last
	// and then sets the name.
	public Person(String n) {
		this();
		System.out.println("Setting the name");
		this.name = n;
	}

	// This will be the first constructor called in the chain. It then calls the
	// second constructor with
	// only the name parameter and sets the age itself.

	public Person(String n, int a) {
		this("Barack Obama");
		System.out.println("Setting the age");
		this.age = a;
	}

	int getAge() {
		return this.age;
	}

	String getName() {
		return this.name;
	}

	void setAge(int a) {
		this.age = a;
	}

	void setName(String n) {
		this.name = n;
